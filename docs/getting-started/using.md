## Interacting with your Pixel

The pixel has 6 buttons on the back side: the 4 directional ones you use with your left hand, and **A**/**B** with your right. **A** is used for accepting/continuing, and **B** for declining/stopping. All apps by default will exit when you press **B**.

## Launcher

The badge boots into a launcher application, from which you can run all the apps you've installed with the **up**/**down** buttons. **A** starts the selected app.

You can remove any app that you install through the app store by pressing **B** in the launcher. System apps are protected from removal. Source code of these system apps can be found [on Github](https://github.com/badgeteam/ESP32-platform-firmware/tree/feature/pixel/firmware/python_modules/pixel).

In the launcher you can adjust the brightness of the display with the <strong>left</strong>/<strong>right</strong> buttons. You might want to decrease the brightness a bit now, as the Pixel ships with maximum brightness configured.. :)
