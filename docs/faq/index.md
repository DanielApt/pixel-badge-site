## Do I need an 18650 li-ion battery to use the Pixel?

No, the Pixel is perfectly happy being powered only by its USB C port. You can insert a battery if you want to walk around with the Pixel. We find it's great fun to wear it at (virtual, during the pandemic) conferences.

## Can I make my own diffuser?

Absolutely! Our diffuser design will be made public when it's done, and there are a [few existing designs](https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=campzone+2019&type=things&sort=relevant) for the CampZone 2019 event badge that the Pixel was based on.
